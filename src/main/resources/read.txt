Description:
Encrypt this!

You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

Your message is a string containing space separated words.
You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
The first letter needs to be converted to its ASCII code.
The second letter needs to be switched with the last letter
Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in input.
Examples:
Kata.encryptThis("Hello") => "72olle"
Kata.encryptThis("good") => "103doo"
Kata.encryptThis("hello world") => "104olle 119drlo"
